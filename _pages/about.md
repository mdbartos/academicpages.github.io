Hi. I am a Ph.D. candidate studying Civil Engineering at the University of Michigan. 

▶ Research
------

My research focuses on building wireless sensor networks to enable real-time monitoring and control of urban water systems.

Some ongoing applications include a real-time flood monitoring network in the Dallas--Fort Worth metroplex, and a pilot stormwater control network in the City of Ann Arbor. 

I also develop new algorithms for data assimilation, event detection, and sensor/controller placement. 

▶ Software
------

When I'm not doing research, I like to write scientific software. I am a lead developer on a number of open-source libraries, including:

- **pysheds**: a popular digital elevation model processing toolkit.
- **rrcf**: an unsupervised streaming anomaly detection algorithm.
- **perfect-cell**: robust firmware for wireless PSoC motes.
- **superlink**: a hydraulic solver for sewer/channel networks.
