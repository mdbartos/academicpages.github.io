Hi. I am a Ph.D. candidate studying Civil Engineering at the University of Michigan. My research focuses on using wireless sensor networks to enable real-time monitoring and control of urban water systems. Some ongoing applications include a real-time flood monitoring network in the Dallas--Fort Worth metroplex, and a pilot stormwater control network in the City of Ann Arbor. 

In addition to my research, I also like to write scientific software. I am a lead developer on a number of open-source libraries, including:

- `pysheds`: a popular digital elevation model processing toolkit.
- `rrcf`: an unsupervised streaming anomaly detection algorithm.
- `perfect-cell`: robust firmware for wireless PSoC motes.
- `superlink`: a hydraulic solver for sewer/channel networks.
