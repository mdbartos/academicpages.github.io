Hi. I am a Ph.D. candidate studying Civil Engineering at the University of Michigan. 

▶ Research
------

My research focuses on developing the next generation of [*smart* urban water systems](https://mattbartos.com/publication/2017-12-22-open).

Ongoing applications include a [real-time flood monitoring network](https://mattbartos.com/publication/2019-02-27-hydrologic) in the Dallas--Fort Worth metroplex, and a pilot [stormwater control network](https://mattbartos.com/publication/2018-07-13-shaping) in the City of Ann Arbor. 

I also develop [new algorithms](https://mattbartos.com/publication/2019-03-28-hydrograph) for data assimilation, event detection, and sensor/controller placement. 

▶ Software
------

When I'm not doing research, I like to write scientific software. I am a lead developer on a number of open-source libraries, including:

- [pysheds](https://github.com/mdbartos/pysheds): a popular digital elevation model processing toolkit.
- [rrcf](https://github.com/kLabUM/rrcf): an unsupervised streaming anomaly detection algorithm.
- [perfect-cell](https://github.com/open-storm/perfect-cell): robust firmware for wireless PSoC motes.
- [superlink](https://github.com/mdbartos/superlink): a hydraulic solver for sewer/channel networks.
